# Crowwwww of Judgement

The one and only Crow of Judgement, now in your Chrome to judge your life choices.

Crowwwww is a Chrome plugin that keeps you from getting distracted by irrelevant websites during your work. Whenever you look at random websites such as Facebook or YouTube, a judgemental crow would appear to stare at you in the eye, forcing you to reconsider your life decisions and go back to work.

Having fun watching cat videos on YouTube? Well, let's see how you have fun with this crow staring into your soul:
